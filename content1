Creating a diagram for pytest might not be as straightforward as for some other concepts, but I can provide you with a simplified diagram to illustrate how pytest works:

```

        |   Test File(s)        |

        |   Pytest Framework     |
        |   (pytest package)    |
        |                       |
        +-----------+-----------+
                    |
                    v

        |                       |
        |   Assertion Checking   |
        |      (assertions)      |
        |                       |
        +-----------+-----------+

                    v
        +-----------+-----------+
        |                       |
        |   Fixture Management   |
        |      (fixtures)        |
        |                       |
        +-----------+-----------+
                    |
                    v

        |   Test Execution       |
        |    and Reporting       |
        |                       |
        +-----------+-----------+
                    |
                    v
        +-----------+-----------+
        |                       |
        |   Test Results         |
        |    (pass/fail)        |
        |                       |
        +-----------------------+
```

This diagram represents the basic flow of pytest:

1. **Test File(s)**: These are Python files containing test functions. Test functions typically start with `test_` and use assertions to verify code behavior.

2. **Pytest Framework**: Pytest is the testing framework that collects and runs the tests. It provides a rich set of features for test discovery, execution, and reporting.

3. **Assertion Checking**: Pytest evaluates assertions in the test functions. If an assertion fails, the test fails.

4. **Fixture Management**: Pytest allows you to define fixtures, which are functions that provide setup and teardown logic for tests. Fixtures can be used to create reusable setup code across multiple tests.

5. **Test Execution and Reporting**: Pytest executes the tests and generates a report indicating which tests passed and which failed.

6. **Test Results**: The final output of pytest is the test results, which include information about the number of tests executed, passed, and failed.

This diagram simplifies the process of how pytest works, focusing on the key components involved in writing and running tests with pytest.
